# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

## Description

This project involves analyzing time series data to identify and rectify non-stationarity, and applying ARIMA and SARIMA models for forecasting. Stationarity was examined using the ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) and KPSS (Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin) tests. Non-stationarity was addressed through differencing and transformations. ARIMA and SARIMA models were implemented by analyzing ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plots. The most suitable model was selected based on residual analysis, the statistical significance of coefficients, and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
